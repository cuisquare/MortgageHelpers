\title{Implied remaining mortgage term assuming constant base payment}
\usage{
implied_term_months(rate, capital, base_payment, rest = 12)
}
\arguments{
\item{rate}{Numeric scalar. Annual interest rate (e.g. \code{0.039} for 3.9\%).}

\item{capital}{Numeric scalar. Remaining mortgage capital after a payment.}

\item{base_payment}{Numeric scalar. Monthly payment assumed going forward
(typically the contractual payment excluding overpayments).}

\item{rest}{integer, defaults to 12 for monthly payments}
}
\value{
Numeric scalar. Remaining term in months. May be \code{Inf}.
}
\description{
Computes the implied remaining term (in months) for a mortgage given
the current outstanding capital, a constant monthly payment, and
a fixed annual interest rate.
}
\details{
This represents the number of months it would take to fully repay the
remaining capital **if no further overpayments are made** and the base
payment is kept constant.


If \code{base_payment <= capital * rate / 12}, the mortgage does
not amortise and the implied remaining term is infinite.
}
\examples{
implied_term_months(
  capital = 150000,
  base_payment = 900,
  rate = 0.04
)
